# Random Plot Generation

This script generates three different random plots using the matplotlib library in Python. The first plot shows a series of random integers generated using randint, while the second plot shows a series of random values generated using randrange. The third plot generates a random walk, which is a series of random steps that accumulate over time. The length of the walk and the seed value used to generate the plot can be passed as command line arguments.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Matplotlib

## Usage

```
python random_plot.py <seed_value> <length_of_walk>

```

## Examples

Generating the third plot using a seed value of 1 and a walk length of 50:

```
python random_plot.py 1 50

```
